                    I recommend trabacus to all travel and holiday service providers. 
                    It is such a beautiful system that it can be useful for an enterprise with a staff of 2 and also one with 100. 
                    It will end all your day to day issues such as response time, customer service issues, communication on-time &amp; 
                    add a very professional outlook to your organzation with its excellent way of presenting information to your customers. 
                    The reports help you in analyzing your strengths &amp; weaknesses. They also tell you about the performance of the staff. 
                    It is in true sense, a 360 degree software, which gives you a complete view of your organisation.
